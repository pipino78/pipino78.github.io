     <p>“In my early professional years I was asking the question: How can I treat, or cure, or change this person? Now I would phrase the question in this way: How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for his own personal growth?”

       <p>At various times in our life, issues can surface that make our journeys more difficult. These can be echoes from past experience that find voice or immediate challenges that disturb and distort our view of the world. Therapy can help you deal with difficult events and overcome challenging times in your life. </p>

       <h2>Group Therapy</h2>
       <p>Group therapy provides opportunities to explore interpersonal dynamics and develop insight into interpersonal patterns, how to respond to others, and how these responses impact the relationships. Group therapy gives members unique opportunities to explore their own interpersonal patterns within the group context, try out new ways of being with others in the safety of the group, and receive constructive interpersonal feedback from their fellow group members about how they are experienced and how they impact others.</p>

      <p class="lead">I have been a practising Counselling and Psychotherapist since 2013 and I hold a BA(Honours) in Counselling and Psychotherapy from CIT – Cork. I am a pre-accredited Psychotherapist with IACP and IAHIP.
I have experience in dealing with a wide-range of issues and presenting problems such as:

Bereavement & Loss, Anger Issues, Anxiety, Chronic Illness or Health Problems, Cultural Issues, Anxiety and Depression, Divorce, Separation & Relationships, Family Issues, Low Self Esteem, Sexual Issues, Spiritual Issues, Stress Management, Traumas, Personal development, Spirituality.

I have been doing my placement in a mental health organizazion in Cork since the beginning of 2016. I have volunteered with ARC centre in Cork for a while and I volunteered with an organization in South America working with young people affected by mental health (autism, Down syndrome) issues and indigenous communities. In this capacity, I have been able to focus on the spiritual, cultural, as well as the general face of therapy.
I have worked with clients who have been in other traumatic situations such as survivors of physical, domestic and sexual abuse.

      <h2 id="myApproach" class="featurette-heading">My Approach</h2>
      <p class="lead">Is based on the integrative psychotherapy humanistic approach, which places the client and the psychotherapist on the same human level facilitating the therapeutic relationship and a deep acceptance of the Other as a Person. The work consists in creating a safe, confidential and supportive environment where the client will feel accepted and not judged. This approach draws from a number of rich theoretical frameworks such as Person Centred, Gestalt therapy, Transactional Analysis, Attachment, Complex Trauma, Character styles, IFS (Internal Family System) and Existential Therapy.
I also make use of a Mindfulness approach which helps clients to be able to gain awareness of the present moment, reduces dwelling on the past and anxiety about the future.
